# University_Grading_System
## This project is about developing a grading system with two different modes, teacher mode and student mode.
### Teachers can insert how many modules they teach, how many students in each module, how many assessments in each module, and the wight of each assessment and then get the choice of printing all data. 
### Student mode allows students to enter their name and then the program will show which modules they are enrolled in, and the student will choose one and his/her grades will be shown to them, then the program will keep running until the user choose to exit.
